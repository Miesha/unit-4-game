**The Crystal Challenge**  
  

The Crystal Challenge game is a jQuery web based game that compares a computer random generated number to four hidden random  generated numbers assigned to crystals. The objective is to correctly select crystals with values, when added together, that  will equal the sum of the computer generated number. You can choose the same crystal multiple times. If the crystals the user chooses exceeds the computer's number, you lose. 


The Crystal Challenge is a easy game that challenges the player's memory as the player must remember the value of each hidden crystal. This game also focusses on the enhancement of addition and multiplication skills.
